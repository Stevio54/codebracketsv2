Hello Everyone, my name is Steven Carnes, and I am a programmer with 14 years experience in the field from multiple points of view (Web, Desktop, inside, outside, at the beach).

My current vantage point is that of... "The Cloud".

While looking around from this new vantage point, I have found that resources for those of us that are more "Code-Centric" can sometimes be hard to find.

As a part of my journey tackling the large array of tools, CMPs (Cloud Management Platforms), and Orchestration platforms out there, I have picked up a lot of tricks, tips, and ideas along the way.

My goal, is to share with all of you these nuggets of knowledge as I come by them, and hopefully they will prove useful.

### Do I like walks on the beach?
---
I consider myself a bleeding-edge kind of developer. I am interested in continued education and learning new things as often as I possibly can.

I love walks on the beach, as long as it doesn't take away from any of my time playing video games, cooking, or reading nerd literature!

I am a huge Nintendo Collector, and below is an image of my small starter collection now:

My collection does sit in the living room as my awesome wife loves to decorate nerdy as well. You can say we keep the nerd meter at maximum in my house :)

### How can we contact you? What are your deets?
---
I can be best reached at my twitter account below, as well as through the Disqus comment's on this site of course :)

I hope to also learn from each of you so we can collaborate on future knowledge.

### What is next?
---
In the coming weeks, I plan to start by blogging about some of the projects I have built in the past, as well as some that are coming along in the near future. You can also keep an eye out for any other small nuggets of information I will share when it become available as well!

I hope to see you there!
