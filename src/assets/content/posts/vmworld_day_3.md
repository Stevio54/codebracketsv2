# Start of the day

For today, I started it going to be a part of the Design Partner Program for Cloud Automation so I was unable to attend the Day 2 General Session. However, I was able to view it here: [VMWorld 2019 Day 2 General Session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MECTRZza7VQ).

I can share that what I have seen of the future of Automation tooling at VMware, it is a very bright future indeed!

# Sessions!

Today, I was able to join in on some sessions and was not dissapointed as seen below:

I was able to attend two sesssions, both of which were awesome and enlightening!

## CODE2219U - Python 101 for the vAdmin

I may blog in more detail about what was discussed here, but I found this session very enlightening in how it showed us just how easy it is to get started with Python to manage our workloads!

The session was very interactive and included plenty of demo's which all went swimmingly (thank the Demo Gods!).

When I find a recording for this session, I will post it here.

Huge thanks to @codedearkland and @kmruddy for an awesome session.

## CODE2216U - The Art of Code That Writes Code

The second and final Session for my day was a session once again ran by @kmruddy and one of the most enjoyable subjects.

This session covered the OpenAPI specification and how the awesome teams at VMware have built and supplied us all with a tool to convert Swagger specs over to OpenAPI so that we can then generate code from it.

Demo's were wrapped around the concept of doing this for the VMware vSphere  Rest API's and I cannot count how many times it can be useful to take this approach!

When I locate the recording of this session it will be placed: here.

Thanks again @kmruddy for your awesome work.

# Solutions Exchange - Round 2 - Hall Crawl

One of the other awesome activies always found on Tuesday night is the Hall Crawl. This is an event that takes place at the Solutions Exchange area.

During this event, several of the innovators supply food and drink to attendees. Of course the drinks are swometimes of the micro-brewery variety and the food on display is very diverse.

In addition to this, some of these innovators invite celebrity guests (Joe Montana could be seen this time around), and can sometimes offer games and challenges only available this night.

There is something fun for everyone that is looking for it!

### Bye for now
This ends my Day 3 recap, some images can be seen below of my day, but I will see all of you tomorrow!
