# Introduction

My name is Steven Carnes and I am a consultant with a VMware Partner. This is my third VMWorld and I would have to say, I love this conference!

I wanted to share my enthusiasm with as many people as possible, to hopefully encourage more to come and take part in this awesome 4 days of fun.

Let us begin with Day 1....

# Registration and Materials

The first step when you arrive (I encourage you to arrive on Sunday for this, as it is much quicker), is to pick up your conference badge and materials.

Different from the last two years, we are situated in the beautiful city of San Francisco (previously, we were in Las Vegas, NV), so these two actions will occur in seperate buildings.

In Moscone South, we will pick up our badge. This is made much simpler when using the QR code you can retrieve by downloading the VMWorld 2019 app from Apple Store or Android App Store's alike. Enter in your details at a computer, then stand in the assigned line to get your badge.

After retrieving your badge, you can then leave the building, and walk about a block down the road to the Moscone West building. Here you can retrieve your materials, in the form of a VMWorld 2019 Backpack and VMUG water bottle. 

You can also, of course, donate your bag to a charity if you like as well :)

# Hands-on Labs

The question most have for Sunday is, what to do after getting your badge and materials? Well, there are lots of options. You can **Meet the Experts**, go to **The Square/VM Village** and check out the many things to see there, check out **Cloud City**, or among other activities try your hand at a **Hands-on Lab**. 

This of course, is what I did and I absolutely did not regret it! 

There are so many Labs to choose from in all disciplines, and there is always the added benefit of potentially winning a Raspberry Pi 4 which are being awarded regularly to randomly drawn seats. 

I personally completed all of the **VMware Enterprise PKS** lab. It was very rewarding in the fact that it walked me through the setup of **PKS**, then went ahead and walked me through deploying an application to this cluster, scaling it out, and adding constraints around its security.

I had a blast working through the lab, and the added benefit, is that if you also want to take part in [CloudCredâ„¢ \| Cloud Computing Training & Recognition Platform](https://www.cloudcredibility.com/), then you can also enter in for a free Raspberry Pi sensor amongst other drawings and prizes!

# Welcome Reception

To cap off the night, it is highly suggested to check out the Welcome Reception in the **Solutions Exchange** area! Here you can partake in food & drink all while learning about what all of VMware's partners and collaborators are doing to innovate the landscape of IT.

There are games, prizes, and lots of great products being showcased on the floor, and it is a highlight of the entire week.

## Signing off for now

So, I am going to sign off for now. I am about to start **Day 2** and cannot wait to share with everyone the highlights from the day!
