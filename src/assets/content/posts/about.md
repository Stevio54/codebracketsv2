## Welcome,

Hello Everyone, my name is Steven Carnes, and I am a programmer with 14 years experience in the field from multiple points of view (Web, Desktop, inside, outside, at the beach).

My current vantage point is that of... "The Cloud".

While looking around from this new vantage point, I have found that resources for those of us that are more "Code-Centric" can sometimes be hard to find.

As a part of my journey tackling the large array of tools, CMPs (Cloud Management Platforms), and Orchestration platforms out there, I have picked up a lot of tricks, tips, and ideas along the way.

My goal, is to share with all of you these nuggets of knowledge as I come by them, and hopefully they will prove useful.
