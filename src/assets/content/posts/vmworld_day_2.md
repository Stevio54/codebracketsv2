# Start of the day - Breakfast

To start my second day at VMWorld, I first went and took advantage of the Breakfast that the conference supplies to each of us. I enjoyed a delicious breakfast sandwich and some coffee, which will be needed for the full day ahead!

# General Session

After this, I knew I had two options to watch the General Session on Day 1:

- Join lots of other eager attendees at the General Session stage
- Find somewhere to set up in **The Square** as they will be playing the General Session on the TV screens there.

I chose for the latter option and as a Partner I was able to do so at the **Partner Lounge** area within **The Square**.

There are multiple areas such as this around, such as those for **VMware Champions** which you can find information on joining visit here: [VMware Champions](https://www.vmware.com/learn/VMware_Champions_2018_REG.html?src=&cid=&touch=3&asset=).

# Great Announcements

I plan to blog on these in more detail seperately soon. However, I wanted to highlight what I thought were the biggest announcements of the day:

- VMware Tanzu: As my companies designated consutant for our burgeoning Enterprise PKS area, this is one of the biggest announcements of the day. This team and its new offerings will help enterprises build modern applications, run Kubernetes with consistency across environments, and manage all their Kubernetes clusters from a single control point. This is huge news. More on this in future blogs.
- VMware Tanzu Mission Control: This product will allow us to manage our Kubernetes clusters no matter where they run! A tech preview was accounced.
- Project Pacific: I loved hearing that VMware was going to focus on making Containers a first-class citizen in all their platforms!

After these announcements, I was geared up and ready for some of the meetings I got to take part in with my company and our partnership with VMware.

# Solutions Exchange

I plan to spend more time in the Solutions Exchange soon, but wanted to touch on it briefly here.

This is a great place to see what all the innovators in the industry are doing today. I had a few great chats with some of the groups here such as HashiCorp and Cohesity on what they have contributed to the ecosystem.

I am hoping to have more to talk about on this by end of the conference!

I am starting Day 3 now and am hoping to have much more to share by tomorrow, stay tuned!
